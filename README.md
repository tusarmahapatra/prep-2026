## 🎯 Objective

This repository is a **performance dashboard** for my Google SDE preparation.

Focus:
- Pattern-based DSA mastery
- Interview-grade reasoning & code
- Consistent, trackable progress
- Long-term preparation over shortcuts

## 📊 DSA Performance Dashboard

| Topic | Solved | Target | Progress |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| Arrays & Strings | 1 | 50 | 🟥 2% |
| Hashmaps | 0 | 40 | 🟥 0% |
| Two Pointers | 0 | 30 | 🟥 0% |
| Stacks & Queues | 0 | 30 | 🟥 0% |
| Linked Lists | 0 | 25 | 🟥 0% |
| Trees | 0 | 50 | 🟥 0% |

🟥 0–30% 🟨 30–70% 🟩 70–100%

> This table is updated **during every solving commit**.

## 📘 Solved Problems Log

| # | Problem | Topic | Pattern | Time | Space |
|--|--------|------|--------|------|-------|
| 1 | Best Time to Buy & Sell Stock | Arrays | Prefix Minimum, State Tracking | O(n) | O(1) |

> One row per solved problem.  
> Never delete rows. This is the **source of truth**.

## 🧠 Pattern Usage Tracker

| Pattern | Count |
|-------|------|
| Prefix Minimum | 1 |
| State Tracking | 1 |
| Sliding Window | 0 |
| Two Pointers | 0 |
| Monotonic Stack | 0 |
| DFS / BFS | 0 |
| Recursion | 0 |
| Dynamic Programming | 0 |

Patterns are tracked explicitly to build **intuition**, not memorization.

## 🧩 Problem-Solving Framework

Every problem in this repository follows a consistent approach:

1. Problem restatement & expected output  
2. Brute-force approach  
3. Optimization insight  
4. DSA pattern identification  
5. One-pass / optimal solution  
6. Time & space complexity analysis  

This ensures solutions are **interview-ready**, not just correct.

## 🧠 Skill-to-Code Mapping

| Folder | Core Skills Developed |
|------|----------------------|
| `arrays_strings/` | Sliding window, prefix sums, state tracking |
| `hashmaps/` | Frequency maps, counting, lookups |
| `two_pointers/` | In-place traversal, pointer logic |
| `stacks_queues/` | Monotonic stacks, BFS patterns |
| `linked_list/` | Pointer manipulation, cycles |
| `trees/` | DFS, BFS, recursion, traversal |

---

## ⏱️ Practice Velocity

- 🎯 Daily target: **2–4 problems**
- 📆 Weekly target: **12–15 problems**
- 🔁 Weekly review: Refactor + notes
- 📈 Progress tracked via commits & dashboard

Preparation is treated as a **system**, not motivation.

---

## 🧾 Commit Discipline

Each commit follows a strict, readable format:
[Topic] Problem Name – Key Technique
Examples:
- `[Arrays] Best Time to Buy & Sell Stock – Prefix Minimum`
- `[Trees] Inorder Traversal – DFS`

The commit history itself acts as a **learning timeline**.

---

## 🗺️ Preparation Milestones

| Phase | Focus | Status |
|-----|------|--------|
| Phase 1 | Arrays & Hashmaps | ⬜ |
| Phase 2 | Two Pointers & Stacks | ⬜ |
| Phase 3 | Linked Lists | ⬜ |
| Phase 4 | Trees & Recursion | ⬜ |
| Phase 5 | Graphs & DP | ⬜ |

Milestones are updated only when a phase is **truly complete**.
